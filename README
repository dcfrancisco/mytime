GOAL
----

MyTime is intended to be a minimalistic time track tool.  For me, that
currently means the following:

 - During day-to-day work it takes up minimal screen space, so in a desktop
   environment it stays in the system tray.
 
 - It only has commands for the basic actions: start working on a new or on an
   existing task, stop working, and edit start/end times and task names for
   recent activities. 
 
 - It generally stays out of the way until I use it once a week to generate a
   report of some kind.
   
However, I do also have the following requirements:

 - The tool should work cross-platform, at least Windows and Gnome-on-Linux
   should be supported.
 
 - It should be based on a well-defined, simple, and compact time log file
   format.
 
 - It should be flexible in the reports that can be generated (but not
   necessarily through the GUI: a command-line interface is OK as well).

So why did I start creating yet another time track tool?  Well, I couldn't find
one that fit the above ideas perfectly.  And it was also a good excuse to try
and create a simple GUI in Java, and to get to know Eclipse better, which I
need to do for my day-time job.

TODO
----

 * Build initial screen to indicate starting/stopping work.
 
 * Allow editing of start/end times of work.
 
 * Create an 'About' screen, with acknowledgments for DryIcons' icons.
 
 * Allow specification of a task name.  

 * Design an initial version of the time log file format.
 
 * In the context menu, show a list of recent tasks, and start the timer on
   a task that is selected.
 
 * Make every task/time change persistent to a time log file.  Read this file
   on start-up.
 
 * Add a multi-level 'undo' function to the UI (the time log is not rolled
   back, but an undo entry is added).
   
 * Add a multi-level 'redo' function.
 
 * Allow specification of 'tags' for each task name, to help in reporting. 
 
 * Try to make the application respond to (configurable) global keystrokes.
